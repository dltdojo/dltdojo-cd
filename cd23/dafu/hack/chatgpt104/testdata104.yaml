            Here is a code snippet for connecting to a Redis instance in Node.js
            using the official `redis` npm package:


            ```

            const redis = require('redis');

            const client = redis.createClient({
              host: 'localhost',
              port: 6379
            });


            client.on('connect', () => {
              console.log('Connected to Redis server');
            });


            client.on('error', (err) => {
              console.error('Error connecting to Redis server:', err);
            });

            ```


            In this example, we import the `redis` package, create a new Redis
            client instance with the configuration options for the Redis server
            (in this case, we're connecting to Redis running on the same machine
            on the default port), and then handle the `connect` and `error`
            events emitted by the client instance.
