            Certainly! Here's a basic code snippet for connecting to a MySQL
            database in Typescript using the mysql2 library:


            ```typescript

            import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';


            async function connectToDatabase() {
              const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
                host: 'localhost',
                user: 'your_username',
                password: 'your_password',
                database: 'your_database',
              });

              console.log('Connected to MySQL database');

              // Do any database operations here

              connection.end();
            }


            connectToDatabase().catch((error) => console.log(error));

            ```


            You'll need to replace the placeholders with your actual username,
            password, and database name. After connecting, you can perform any
            database operations within the `connectToDatabase` function. Don't
            forget to close the connection with `connection.end()` when you're
            done!
