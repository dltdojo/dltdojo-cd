            Sure, here's a sample YAML file for deploying an nginx web server
            with two pods:


            ```

            apiVersion: apps/v1

            kind: Deployment

            metadata:
              name: nginx-deployment
              labels:
                app: nginx
            spec:
              replicas: 2
              selector:
                matchLabels:
                  app: nginx
              template:
                metadata:
                  labels:
                    app: nginx
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: nginx-container
                    image: nginx:latest
                    ports:
                    - containerPort: 80
            ```


            This YAML file specifies a deployment with the name
            "nginx-deployment" that will create two replicas (pods) of the nginx
            web server. It includes a selector that matches the label "app:
            nginx" to determine which pods are part of this deployment. The
            template section defines the pod template that will be used to
            create each replica, including the container specification for the
            nginx web server with port 80 exposed.
